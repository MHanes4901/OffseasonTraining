# Lesson 5 - Some Thoughts Before We Start

Don Knuth is one of the great pioneers of software engineering. He once stated something very true: 

_Software is, first and foremost, meant to be read by human beings. Only incidentally does it get executed by a machine._

This is something that is good to keep in mind for any software writing, but especially when writing code in a team environment. The software is intended to _communicate to other team members_ what your _intent_ for the robot's functionality is. It just so happens we use this "java" thing to express that intent, so that the robot can eventually run that software too.

Intent is best-expressed by:

1) Choosing good, meaningful names for your variables and methods.
2) Applying liberal code comments to explain the "why" 
3) Keeping "like" code in one spot (ie: Don't put arm code into the shooter.java file)
4) Splitting out code into meaningful sub-chunks (ie: break long segments of code into methods with cohesive outcomes)
5) Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) (ie: use methods to re-use code chunks, don't copy-paste)

The good news is you've already learned most of the organizational tools needed to write good code. The bad news is that it still takes practice to become proficient at using those tools. But fear not! The very fact you are reading this means you're already on the path to becoming more proficient! Keep up the hard work, and you'll be amazed where it will take you!
