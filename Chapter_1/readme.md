# Chapter 1 - The Beginning

In Chapter 1, we introduce the basics of software-writing concepts that are relevant to creating robot code. We'll be focused on core-concepts and tools, while making some hints to robot-specific behaviors and patterns.

Complete these lessons in order, as each one builds on the next.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have completed all necessary software install processes. Talk to mentors or returning students for info about this.

Additionally, ensure you have a github account which is associated with the team. Ask mentors or returning students for help on this. Be sure to have your github username and password available and ready to use.
