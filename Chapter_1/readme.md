# Chapter 1 - The Beginning

In Chapter 1, we introduce the basics of software-writing concepts that are relevant to creating robot code. We'll be focused on core-concepts and tools, while making some hints to robot-specific behaviors and patterns.

Complete these Lessons in Order, as each one builds on the next.
