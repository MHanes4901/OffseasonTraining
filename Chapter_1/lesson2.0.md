There are two broad categories of tasks we will perform while developing software: "Turnkey" tasks, and "Creative" tasks.

"Turnkey" tasks are things that "you just have to do." They're things like installing software, loading code on the robot, typing out code for a math expression, committing/pushing code in git, or copying files from old code. There shouldn't be a ton of creative thought involved. You just know there's a certain sequence of steps to do, a bunch of stuff that happens behind the scenes that you don't have to think about, and something useful that happens at the end. Kinda like turning the key in your car to start it: A simple set of actions, a lot of complexity behind the scenes, but the useful thing gets done at the end.

The key to success at turnkey tasks is just _memorizing_ how to do them. Ideally they're only a step or two, so it's easy to memorize. Worst case, write down the steps in a document, and memorize where you keep that document.

"Creative" tasks are ones that require creative thought and planning to execute. _Designing_ software is a key example of this. Naming variables is another. Choosing between two sensors often requires creativity. This is often the work that at least _looks_ harder. Even professionals spend days agonizing over how to design just a few lines of code.

The key to success at creative tasks is two-fold: _breaking the problem into smaller problems_ and _pattern matching_. Most problems requiring creative solutions first have to be broken down into smaller problems. Then, the smaller problems are solved by finding similar problems with known solutions. Finally, you build up a big solution from all your smaller ones.

Creative problem solving is the hardest to teach, because it involves teaching _how to think_, rather than simply _what to think_. 

For the offseason, we tend to focus more on the turnkey tasks, as they tend to be the basis of the solutions to creative tasks. We'll try to introduce parts of the creative thinking process as well, but keep in mind a lot of this education will occur "on-the-job" during the season. Be ready to be "swept along" with the ever-educational current as the team takes off on the design and construction process.

**The mindset to keep**: It's not important to understand _everything_ about programming to be a good programmer. We're all learning and improving all the time. If you work hard and learn all you can during this offseason, we'll guarantee you'll make meaningful contributions during the build season. And every build season and project you work on after, you'll only get better and better!
