# Lesson 4

## Thoughts and Words of Encouragement

What does it take to get "good" at programming?

There's a lot of ways to answer this, but my top answer is: _practice_.

Maybe you play a musical instrument, or have a friend who does. Maybe you/they are really good at it too! Consider the following: _professional_ musicians, who are arguably _really_ good at their instrument, spend 4-5 hours playing their instrument a day. That's 4-5 hours, above and beyond anything "required" for gigs, performances, rehearsal, recording... Just 4-5 hours honing their skills and having fun at it.

Now, programming and playing an instrument isn't an apples-to-apples comparison. So, we shouldn't say everyone should spend 4-5 hours per day on programming, and then they'll be at a professional level. However, keep in mind that scale - to be good at something, you'll likely have to practice for _hours_ on a daily basis, not _minutes_. 

Now, for robotics, we definitely don't need everyone to be a professional programmer to make a good robot. Far from it. In fact, there's no real time commitment outside of robotics at all. And, if you're heavily invested and engaged while you're here, you'll probably get _pretty darn good_ at doing this engineering thing.

However, if you desire to grow even faster, how do you go about doing that? _Practice_. Create personal projects, pick an end goal, lead and guide them yourself, and see how close to your goal you can get! If you need ideas or help on getting started, let any of the mentors or returning students know, they'll have ideas for sure!
