There's a tongue-in-cheek methodology for solving problems often called the [Feynman Algorithm](http://wiki.c2.com/?FeynmanAlgorithm), named for the very smart physicist who (appeared) to use it frequently: 

1) Write down the problem
2) Think really hard
3) Write down the solution

...

Yea, if only it were that easy. And yet, often, when we see folks around us problem solving, that's all it appears they're doing. Everyone sees the problem the same way, but somehow, for _some people_ the answer comes out of thin air. 

Of course, no one's good enough to just stare at a problem and magically come up with the answer. Even Richard Feynman, regularly acknowledged as a genius by his peers, didn't just magically create answers. 

Everyone who appears to do this is actually doing something much more meaningful under the hood. They're accessing their memories, thinking of times when they've seen similar problems. They're breaking the stated problem down into tiny components, solving each individually, and building back up a full solution. They're solving the problem multiple ways, and cross-checking the solution.

If you're _really_ good, you might be able to do that all in your head. More often than not, it requires writing things down. That's ok.

The point is simply: Don't ever get discouraged that others around you seem to be able to see solutions where you do not. They're doing the same thing you're learning to do now: Just applying previous experiences to current problems to solve them.
