## Thoughts and Words of Encouragement

Welcome back! Hopefully you've found our first few lessons informative, perhaps even enjoyable! These rudiments are always the hardest thing to slog through, because the so frequently seem abstract and disconnected from how robots actually work. Fear not, we'll be getting closer to that soon enough here.

You may also notice a lot of these word problems are _poorly written_. There's extra info in them you might not need, and there's vagueness where you either have to make assumptions or ask questions. 

This is intentional. For better or worse, the real world is not as well-defined as we'd like it to be. When designing a robot and writing software for it, we're gonna get blasted with information - some of which we need, some of which we don't. We're also going to be missing large pieces of information, which we'll either have to assume or go ask about. This is all just the normal design and development process - not something to be feared, but rather embraced!

The good news is that lots of folks on the team do this for their job, and have built many robots before. Lean on them for their experience! Ask questions fearlessly, and seek to learn _how to learn_.
