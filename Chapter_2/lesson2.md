### Background

_Sensors_ are devices which measure physical quantities, and report them back to the software. We can use sensors to display information, or control behavior. 

### Limit Switch

"touch sensor" or simply "switch". 

Boolean input

True in one state, False in the other. Often "true when pressed", though not guarnteed.

Three on the robot

Two top of elevator. One bottom.

### Encoder

On elevator

Measures relative rotation

Often have to do math to figure out the quantity of interest. Ex: Elevator height.

### Other 

#### Pressure Sensor

Not on this robot unfortunately. Measures 

#### Distance Sensors

Laser-based, ultrasonic based.

#### Vision processing

Identify angle and range to special targets on the field.

#### Gyroscope
