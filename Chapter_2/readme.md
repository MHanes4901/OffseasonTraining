### Single vs. Double

You may notice there are actually two types of solenoid classes, `Single` and `Double`. A `Single` solenoid has two states (Rev/Fwd), and `Double` solenoid has three states (Rev/Off/Fwd). However, we almost never need that off state, and can usually ignore it. Therefor, unless mechanical dreams up some super fancy-schmancy mechanism, you can just ignore the differences between `Single` and `Double` solenoids. Just ask electrical team which type they're installing on the robot, and use that info to pick between the two.
