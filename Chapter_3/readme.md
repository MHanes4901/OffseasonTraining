# Chapter 3 - Additional Topics

In chapter 2, we took the concepts from chapter 1 and applied them to writing code for a robot that the team had actually built. 

In Chapter 3, we'll start to introduce the basics of some more advanced concepts. These will be less hands-on, and more descriptive in nature. The goal is to provide some high-level background information to inform new students on topics that they usually don't get involved in the details of till later on. They're harder to create specific activities around. So, for now, the goal is simply to provide a basic understanding of what is going on, rather than the details.
